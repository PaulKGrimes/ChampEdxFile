# ChampEdxFile

A Python 2.7 module to read and manipulate .edx Radiation Patterns output by TICRA's CHAMP horn design software.

Currently this can load simple far field horn radiation patterns, select patterns by frequency and plot
individual radiation patterns by component, cut and frequency.

THIS CODE HAS ONLY BEEN MINIMALLY TESTED

Depends on:
 - numpy
 - lxml.etree
 - io.StringIO
 - matplotlib.pyplot
 - NumpyUtility (see my other repository)
